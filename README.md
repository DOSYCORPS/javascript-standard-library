The JavaScript standard library. "Standard Library" Swag for JavaScript.

## This

This idea is the result of asking the following what if question:

- What if there was a "standard library" for JavaScript?

We have Handlebars, RxJS, React, Angular, Lodash, Underscore, Ramda, Math.js.

But unlike Python, C, C++ and Java, there is no "Central" repository "standard" library (just a lot of contributor and OSS project libraries) for JS. Hey, that's a good thing, as well. But it doesn't mean JS has to miss out having a standard library.

The "builtin" library functions included in ECMAScript and in the Browser and Node are incomplete and like maybe 10 - 20% of what a standard library ought to do.

JS is mature. The web is maturing. Browsers are powerful and mature platforms. We've come a long way.

I believe the time has come for a JS standard library. 

Why not?

At least give it a try. StandardJS.
